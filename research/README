Unfortunately, I'm no longer working at the company who originally
sponsored the development of this software.  It also seems as though
nobody there wishes to take over this project, even in terms of
maintenance.

Perhaps that's a compliment...it is extremely stable.  :)

That said, if you're reading this and wish to continue development
of distribulator...feel free!  In this directory, one can find all
of my research and code for non-existent Distribulator v2.0.

P.S. There's a version or two in SVN that were never released as tarballs.
Sorry about that...anyone care to fix it?  ;)
