Required Perl Modules
---------------------

This program does require certain Perl modules to run properly,
and in some cases requires updating Perl's internal modules.

* Cwd            -- Perl Built-in Module
* Getopt::Long   -- No particular version required.
* Net::Ping      -- v2.25 or later REQUIRED.
  If you're getting lots of errors that your servers are down
  when they in fact are not, try installing this module version
  "over" your existing Perl module.  Versions of this
  module included with Perl v5.00x appear to be buggy.
* Pod::Usage     -- No particular version required.
* Sys::Hostname  -- Perl Built-in Module
* Term::ReadLine -- Perl Built-in Module

Quick-Hack Install Directions
-----------------------------

1) Install any required modules via CPAN or by hand.
2) Pick a place you wish to install the distribution
   (the default is /usr/local/novo/distribulator).
3) Untar/gzip the distribution into the directory above your target dir.
4) If not using the default settings, edit distribulator.pl
   and specify where the distribution is installed, and where
   the config files containing server group lists can be found.
5) Fire it up!
6) Type "help" for help.  :-)

Quick-Hack Install Shell Commands
---------------------------------

cd /usr/local/novo/
tar xfz distribulator-0.3.tar.gz
cd distribulator
./distribulator --env=sample
help

This document is more end-user oriented and as such has been placed at
the absolute bottom of the priority list.

However, being that this is not a piece of software most of the world
will ever use, feel free to contact me personally if you need support,
find bugs, have suggestions, etc.
