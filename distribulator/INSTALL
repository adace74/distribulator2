Required Software
-----------------

* A flavor of Unix capable of running Perl 5.6.1.
* Perl 5.6.1 (earlier versions may work, this is what I use)
* GNU libreadline v4.3 (earlier versions may work, but not as well)
* Term::ReadLine::GNU CPAN add-on perl module.

Verified Platforms
------------------
* Various RedHat Linux distributions(v6.2 and v8.0 to be specific),
  in conjunction with perl 5.6.1.  perl 5.8.x has behaved a bit strangely
  for me so I've stuck with 5.6.1 for now.

Quick-Hack Install Directions
-----------------------------

1) Install any required modules via CPAN or by hand.
2) Pick a place you wish to install the distribution
   (the default is /usr/local/novo/distribulator).
3) Untar/gzip the distribution into the directory above your target dir.
4) If not using the default settings, edit wrappers/distribulator
   and Global/Config.pm to specify where the distribution is installed,
   as well as where the config files containing server group lists can be found.
5) Fire it up!
6) Type "help" for help.  :-)

Quick-Hack Install Shell Commands
---------------------------------

cd /usr/local/novo/
tar xfz distribulator-0.x.tar.gz
cd distribulator
./distribulator --env=sample
help

This document is more end-user oriented and as such has been placed at
the absolute bottom of the priority list.

However, being that this is not a piece of software most of the world
will ever use, feel free to contact me personally if you need support,
find bugs, have suggestions, etc.
