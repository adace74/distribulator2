Quick-Hack Install Directions
-----------------------------

1) Pick a place you wish to install the distribution
   (i.e. /usr/local/novo/distribulator).
2) Untar/gzip the distribution into that directory.
3) Edit distribulator.pl, and specify where the distribution
is installed, and where the config files containing server group
lists can be found.
4) Fire it up!
5) Try "help" for help.  :-)

This document is more end-user oriented and as such has been placed at
the absolute bottom of the priority list.

However, being that this is not a piece of software most of the world
will ever use, feel free to contact me personally if you need support,
find bugs, have suggestions, etc.
