You have found perhaps the world's only Open Source
distributed server shell.

Website Easy URL: http://distribulator.turing.com/
Website Real URL: http://sourceforge.net/projects/distribulator/
Announcement Mailing List:
	distribulator-announce-subscribe@lists.sourceforge.net

What Is It?
-----------

The Distribulator concept arised after working with an environment
consisting of about 500 servers, mostly held together with duct tape,
rubber bands, some random scripts, and SSH(okay, I lied about the first
two, but you get the idea).

Despite everyone's best efforts in the rush to keep things working,
no unified effort was made to create a tool that would allow us to
manage various sets of servers in a sane manner.

If completed, the Distribulator will be a shell-like perl-based console
interface designed to "wrap" around SSH in a manner such that
atomic transactions can be applied to multiple servers in
multiple environments, without giving the end-user enough flexibility
to shoot themselves in the foot(I call this the
"Oh crap!  That was production?" situation).

What Will It Do?
----------------

For the moment, the planned feature list and Changelog have
been merged into one document.  Please see the file "Changelog"
in this directory.

Who Is Working On It?
---------------------

Currently there's just me.  However, I'd appreciate all the help I can get!
Whatever company you might work for, your efforts are welcome here.

Just send me an email...
