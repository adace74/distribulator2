Installing The Distribulator
----------------------------

Prerequisites
-------------
Before installing the distribulator, one must have already installed
a copy of the following:

- A Unix-like OS.

The usual suspects.  *BSD, Linux, Solaris, etc.

- Python v2.2.2+ (http://www.python.org/) accessible via /usr/local/bin/python

In theory the distribulator might work on earlier(i.e. v1.5.2) versions
of Python, but I wouldn't bet on it.  Also if you don't have a symlink for python
in /usr/local/bin/, either put on there or hack the distribulator.py first line.

- PyXML v0.8.2+ (http://pyxml.sourceforge.net/)

Oddly enough, some installations seem to load the XML parser
without this package, but in other cases this simply doesn't work.

I personally install this always, as a just-in-case measure.

Installation
------------
1) Pick a place you'd like to install the program.
   The default is /promo/distribulator2 probably not where you'd want it...

   For example, let's say you'd like to install into /apps/distribulator2.

2) Go to the subdir of where you'd like it to be:
   cd /apps/

3) Unpack the distribution:
   tar xfz distribulator-0.50.tar.gz

4) Edit the INSTALL_DIR variable in the scripts/distribulator shell script to
   reflect your installation directory(in this case /apps/distribulator2):
   vi scripts/distribulator

5) Create a symlink from /usr/local/bin/ to the wrapper script
   (or your path-happy location of choice):
   cd /usr/local/bin; ln -s /apps/distribulator2/scripts/distribulator

6) Symlink or copy the config.xml.dist file to config.xml.
   cd /apps/distribulator2/conf; ln -s config.xml.dist config.xml

7) Fire it up:
   distribulator

8) Test it out, tinker around, read the next section for how to
   setup config.xml for your environments.

Configuration Overview
----------------------
This file won't go into extensive detail on the configuration files
listed here, however you'll at least have a starting point.

conf/config.xml -- Main XML configuration file.

This file contains all interesting settings, including binary locations,
server and server group settings, etc.  Most likely this will be the file
of most interest to you.

Settings of interest:
- Binary locations for logname, ping, scp, and ssh.
- Syslog logging facility.
- Server environment(s) and group(s) settings.

config/pass_through_cmds.txt -- Simple list of Unix common commands for
the command-line interface to "pass through", that is to simply run as
a good shell would.

examples/ -- Directory containing example batch files that actually will
attempt to work.

Directory Layout Overview
-------------------------

/distribulator2			- Main install dir.
	/conf			- Configuration dir.
	/doc			- Help file dir.
	/engine			- Core engine Python classes.
		/data/		- Core data Python classes.
	/examples		- Example batch files.
	/generic		- Generic Python classes.
	/scripts		- Wrapper shell scripts.
	/tests			- Manual test suite location,
				  future automated regression tests.
