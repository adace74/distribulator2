Installing The Distribulator
----------------------------

Prerequisites
-------------
Before installing the distribulator, one must have already installed
a copy of the following:

- A Unix-like OS.

The usual suspects.  *BSD, Linux, Solaris, etc.

FYI, the author currently tests on both FreeBSD 4.x and Linux(RedHat) environments.

- GNU Readline v4.3 (http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/~chet/readline/rltop.html)

Nothing special here, readline just Makes Life Easier.

- Python v2.2.X (http://www.python.org/) accessible via /usr/local/bin/python

I've yet to test this with Python v2.3.X, so I'm not entirely sure how the changes
to implement timeoutsocket within the language itself will affect the code.

Also, if you don't have a symlink for python in /usr/local/bin/,
either put on there or hack the distribulator.py first line.

- PyXML v0.8.X (http://pyxml.sourceforge.net/)

Due to a bug in Python v2.2.X, the built-in XML parser is not always found.
The simple workaround is to install PyXML as a just-in-case measure.

Installation
------------
1) Pick a place you'd like to install the program.  The default is /usr/local/distribulator2

   For example, let's say you'd like to install into /apps/distribulator2.

2) Go to the subdir of where you'd like it to be:
   cd /apps/

3) Unpack the distribution:
   tar xfz distribulator-X.X.X.tar.gz

4) Edit the INSTALL_DIR variable in the scripts/distribulator shell script to
   reflect your installation directory(in this case /apps/distribulator2):
   vi scripts/distribulator

5) Create a symlink from /usr/local/bin/ to the wrapper script
   (or your path-happy location of choice):
   cd /usr/local/bin; ln -s /apps/distribulator2/scripts/distribulator.sh distribulator

6) Symlink or copy the config.xml.dist file to config.xml.
   cd /apps/distribulator2/conf; ln -s config.xml.dist config.xml

7) Fire it up:
   distribulator

8) Test it out, tinker around, read the next section for how to
   setup config.xml for your environments.

Configuration Overview
----------------------
This file won't go into extensive detail on the configuration files
listed here, however you'll at least have a starting point.

conf/config.xml -- Main XML configuration file.

This file contains all interesting settings, including binary locations,
server and server group settings, etc.  Most likely this will be the file
of most interest to you.

Settings of interest:
- Binary locations for logname, scp, and ssh.
- Syslog logging facility.
- Host Pinger options.
- Server environment(s) and group(s) settings.

config/pass_through_cmds.txt -- Simple list of Unix common commands for
the command-line interface to "pass through", that is to simply run as
a good shell would.

examples/ -- Directory containing example batch files that should work
if configuration is setup properly.

Directory Layout Overview
-------------------------

/distribulator2			- Main install dir.
	/conf			- Configuration dir.
	/doc			- Help file dir.
	/engine			- Core engine Python classes.
	/examples		- Example batch files.
	/generic		- Generic Python classes.
	/scripts		- Wrapper shell scripts.
	/tests			- Manual test suite location,
				  future automated regression tests.
