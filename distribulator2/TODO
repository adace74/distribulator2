Short-term TODO List
--------------------
* Stabilization / testing:
    1) Usage testing.
    2) Bug collection / fixes.
    3) Code refactoring as makes sense.
    4) Throw a baby at it!
    5) Automated regression functionality test system.

* Design Fixage:
    1) Review all objects and implement static objects as appropriate.
       (BatchRunner, CommandLine)
    2) Review object naming, refer to design patterns, and fix them.
       (currently icky-but-works)
    3) Squash all currently outstanding bugs.
    4) Take a closer look at the parsing logic for the "copy" command.
       Currently it's "good enough" but could be better in the way it
       handles spaces within server / server group lists.
