Short-term TODO List
--------------------
* Stabilization / testing:
    1) Usage testing.
    2) Bug collection / fixes.
    2) Code refactoring as makes sense.
    3) Throw a cat at it!

* Bugs:
    1) Currently we log the usage of the "cd" command.
       This is rather silly...take a close look at CommandLine and CommandRunner,
       make appropriate changes.
    2) Review all objects and implement static objects as appropriate(BatchRunner, CommandLine).
    3) Review object naming, refer to design patterns, and fix them(currently icky-but-works).
    4) Start using SourceForge's bug tracker.  First one -- copy really should act more like cp
       and take multiple files as arguments.  The current way kinda sucks.
    5) Another bug is we really should respect the facility setting in config.xml,
       right now it's hard-coded.
