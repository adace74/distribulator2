Copy Command Syntax & Examples
-----------------------------

Syntax: copy source_path [dest_server|dest_server_group,dest_server|dest_server_group...]:dest_path [now]

Description: Copies files to/from various servers within our working environment.

Examples:
    copy /tmp/blah.txt /tmp/
    - Copies local file /tmp/blah.txt to directory /tmp/
      on the current server group.
    copy /tmp/blah.txt /tmp/ now
    - Copies local file /tmp/blah.txt to directory /tmp/
      on the current server group, skipping the are-you-sure question.
    copy /tmp/blah.txt app:/tmp/
    - Copies local file /tmp/blah.txt to directory /tmp/
      on the 'app' server group.
    copy /tmp/blah.txt app:/tmp/ now
    - Copies local file /tmp/blah.txt to directory /tmp/
      on the 'app' server group, skipping the are-you-sure question.
    copy /tmp/blah.txt app,www:/tmp/
    - Copies local file /tmp/blah.txt to directory /tmp/
      on the app and www server groups.

    copy /tmp/blah.txt app[fredco]:/tmp/
    - Copies local file /tmp/blah.txt to directory /tmp/
      on servers matching the 'fredco' attribute.

    copy /tmp/blah.txt app01:/tmp/
    - Copies local file /tmp/blah.txt to directory /tmp/
      on a server matching app01.
    copy /tmp/blah.txt app01,www01:/tmp/
    - Copies local file /tmp/blah.txt to directory /tmp/
      on 2 servers matching app01 and www01.

Notes:
    The hostname search algorithm has been tweaked in such a way that
    matches will be based on DNS hostname.  For instance, 'login app0'
    will -not- match app01.somewhere.com while 'login app01' will.

TODO:
    Eventually it'd be extremely useful to add permutations of this
    command to allow for single / many remote-to-local file copy, as well as
    server1-to-server2 file copy functionality.
