Run Command Syntax & Examples
-----------------------------

Syntax: run [ssh_flags] "command" on [server|server_group,server|server_group...] [now|reverse|single|threads]

Description: Runs a given command across multiple servers, in either normal or reverse sort order.

Examples:
    run "uptime"            -- Runs uptime on current server group
                               in forward sort order.
    run "uptime" now        -- Runs uptime on current server group
                               in forward sort order, skipping the are-you-sure question.
    run "uptime" reverse    -- Runs uptime on current server group
                               in reverse sort order.
    run "uptime" single     -- Runs uptime on a single server
                               within the current server group.

    run "uptime" on app     -- Runs uptime on app server group in forward sort order.
    run "uptime" on app single
                            -- Runs uptime on a single server
                               with the app server group.
    run "uptime" on app,www -- Runs uptime on app and www server groups
                               in forward sort order.
    run "uptime" on app,www now
                            -- Runs uptime on app and www server groups
                               in forward sort order, skipping the are-you-sure question.
    run "uptime" on app,www reverse
                            -- Runs uptime on app and www server groups
                               in reverse sort order.
    run "uptime" on app,www single
                            -- Runs uptime on a single server
                               within both app and www server groups.

    run "uptime" on app01   -- Runs uptime on a server matchining app01.
    run "uptime" on app01,www01
                            -- Runs uptime on 2 servers matching app01 and www01
                               in forward sort order.
    run -t "vi"             -- Runs vi on current server group,
                               in forward sort order, and forces an ssh tty.
    run -t "vi" on app,www  -- Runs vi on app and www server groups,
                               in forward sort order, and forces an ssh tty.

    run "uptime" on app[bobco]
                            -- Runs uptime on app servers matching 'bobco' attribute value.

    run "uptime" on app[bobco],db[fredco]
                            -- Runs uptime on app servers matching 'bobco' attribute value
                               and db servers matching the 'bobco' attribute value.

TODO:

    run "uptime" on app threads
                            -- Runs uptime on app servers in parallel, using threads.

    run "uptime" on app where brand="strawberry"
                            -- Runs uptime on app servers with
                               attribute name "brand" and attribute value "bobco".

    run "uptime" on app where regex="0[123]"
			    -- Runs uptime on app servers that match regex 0[123]



Notes:
    The hostname search algorithm has been tweaked in such a way that
    matches will be based on DNS hostname.  For instance, 'login app0'
    will -not- match app01.somewhere.com while 'login app01' will.
