The Distribulator contains several classes for various functionality.

This package contains classes considered generic enough for reuse
in other applications.

Class Overview:

generic.FilePrinter - Simple class to dump a textfile to the screen.
generic.HostPinger  - Simple class to try and "ping" a given host.
generic.SysLogger   - Simple class to interface with the syslog module.

NOTE: The generic.HostPinger class has been depricated in favor of
      the new-and-improved engine.misc.HostPinger.
