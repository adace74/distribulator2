You have found perhaps the world's only Open Source distributed server shell.

Website Easy URL: http://distribulator.turing.com/
Website Real URL: http://sourceforge.net/projects/distribulator/
Announcement Mailing List:
	distribulator-announce-subscribe@lists.sourceforge.net

What Is It?
-----------
The Distribulator concept arised after working with an environment
consisting of over 750 servers, in a company where there aren't nearly
that many employees total -- much less just to maintain servers!

Unfortunately life's daily busywork has kept most everyone from having
the time in the office to develop longer-term solutions.

If completed, the Distribulator will have two modes:

* Shell: A console interface designed to "wrap" around SSH,
  but will also allow local commands to be run.  The idea here is to provide
  people who have to do "fire fights" in a production environment with the best
  common toolset available.

* Batch: A batch mode suitable to allow one set of personnel create a batch file
  ala shell-script that can be tested in one environment, then handed off
  to a seperate group for implementation in another environment. 

This program shell also attempt to impose some sanity-oriented restructions,
such as environment isolation, in the hopes of avoiding problems that result
in exclaimations like "Oh crap!  That was production?"

What Will It Do?
----------------
Please see the file "Changelog" located in this directory.

Where can I read more extensive documentation?
----------------------------------------------
Uh...the source code?  Sorry, but for the moment the most extensive
documentation is from running the Perl version like so:
"distribulator.pl --help"

The Python rewrite / improvement effort is being focused on for the time
being -- once I have a reasonable release to document I'll do so.

Who Is Working On It?
---------------------
Currently there's just me.  However, I'd appreciate all the help I can get!
Whatever company you might work for, your efforts are welcome here.

Just send me an email...
