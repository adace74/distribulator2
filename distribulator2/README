What Is It?
-----------
The Distribulator concept arised after working with an environment
consisting of over 750 servers, in a company where there aren't nearly
that many employees total -- much less just to maintain servers!

The Distribulator is a longer-term project whose goal is to provide
"the rest of us" not running advanced cluster-oriented OS-level software --
but still need to maintain a server cluster.

Currently, the Distribulator has two modes:

* Console: A console interface designed to "wrap" around SSH,
  but will also allow local commands to be run.  The idea here is to provide
  people who have to do "fire fights" in a production environment with the best
  common toolset available.

* Batch: A batch mode suitable to allow one set of personnel create a batch file
  ala shell-script that can be tested in one environment, then handed off
  to a seperate group for implementation in another environment. 

This program shell also attempt to impose some sanity-oriented restructions,
such as environment isolation, in the hopes of avoiding problems that result
in exclaimations like "Oh crap!  That was production?"  This is otherwise known
as the "environment blinder" feature.

What Will It Do?
----------------
Please see the "Changelog" file located in this directory.

How do I install it?
--------------------
Please see the "INSTALL" file located in this directory.

What are the known bugs?
------------------------
Please see the Sourceforge project site, click on the "Bugs" link.

Where can I read more extensive documentation?
----------------------------------------------
Sorry, but for the moment the most extensive documentation can be found
by running "distribulator.py --help" and using the "help" command
once the console mode has started properly.

Who Is Working On It?
---------------------
Currently there's just me.  However, I'd appreciate all the help I can get!
Whatever organization you might work for, your efforts are welcome here.

Just send me an email...
