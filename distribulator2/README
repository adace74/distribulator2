You have found perhaps the world's only Open Source stand-alone
distributed server shell command / batch system.

Website Easy URL: http://distribulator.turing.com/
Website Real URL: http://sourceforge.net/projects/distribulator/
Announcement Mailing List:
	distribulator-announce-subscribe@lists.sourceforge.net

What Is It?
-----------
The Distribulator concept arised after working with an environment
consisting of over 750 servers, in a company where there aren't nearly
that many employees total -- much less just to maintain servers!

Unfortunately life's daily busywork has kept most everyone from having
the time in the office to develop longer-term solutions.

Currently, the Distribulator has two modes:

* Console: A console interface designed to "wrap" around SSH,
  but will also allow local commands to be run.  The idea here is to provide
  people who have to do "fire fights" in a production environment with the best
  common toolset available.

* Batch: A batch mode suitable to allow one set of personnel create a batch file
  ala shell-script that can be tested in one environment, then handed off
  to a seperate group for implementation in another environment. 

This program shell also attempt to impose some sanity-oriented restructions,
such as environment isolation, in the hopes of avoiding problems that result
in exclaimations like "Oh crap!  That was production?"

What Will It Do?
----------------
Please see the file "Changelog" located in this directory.

How might I install this?
-------------------------
1) Pick a place you'd like to install the program(the default is /promo/distribulator2,
   probably nothing like where you'd want it!).

   For example, let's say you'd like to install it in /apps/distribulator2.
2) Go there:
	cd /apps/
3) Unpack the distribution:
	tar xfz distribulator-0.50.tar.gz (the distribulator2 dir is included in the tarball)
4) Edit the INSTALL_DIR variable in the scripts/distribulator shell script to
   reflect your installation directory:
	vi distribulator2/scripts/distribulator
5) Create a symlink from /usr/local/bin/ (or your path-happy location of choice):
	cd /usr/local/bin; ln -s /apps/distribulator2/scripts/distribulator
6) Fire it up:
	distribulator
7) Play around, read README.config, attempt to comprehend this funky program.

Where can I read more extensive documentation?
----------------------------------------------
Uh...the source code?  Sorry, but for the moment the most extensive
documentation is from running "distribulator.py --help" and the "help" command
once the console mode has started properly.

Who Is Working On It?
---------------------
Currently there's just me.  However, I'd appreciate all the help I can get!
Whatever organization you might work for, your efforts are welcome here.

Just send me an email...
