What Is It?
-----------
The Distribulator concept arised after working with an environment
consisting of over 750 servers, in a company where there aren't nearly
that many employees total -- much less just to maintain servers!

The Distribulator is a longer-term project whose goal is to provide
"the rest of us" not running advanced cluster-oriented OS-level software --
but still need to maintain a server cluster.

Currently, the Distribulator has three modes:

* Batch: A batch mode suitable to allow one set of personnel create a batch file
  ala shell-script that can be tested in one environment, then handed off
  to a seperate group for implementation in another environment.

* Console: A console interface designed to "wrap" around SSH,
  but will also allow local commands to be run.  The idea here is to provide
  people who have to do "fire fights" in a production environment with the best
  common toolset available.

* List: A list mode suitable to retrieving set lists of servers or server groups,
  quite useful for shell or Perl integration.

This program shell also attempts to impose some sanity-oriented restrictions,
such as environment isolation, in the hopes of avoiding problems that result
in exclaimations like "Oh crap!  That was production?"  This is otherwise known
as the "environment blinder" feature.
