Legend For Changes Below:
"-" Indicates a change that hasn't even been started on.
"+" Indicates a change that is currently being developed.
"*" Indicates a change that is at least 80%(if not 100%) complete.

Change List For v0.3 (Shipped):

* Some semblance of a shell, include a useful prompt.
  Now includes 'cat', 'cd', and 'ls' for local server browsing.
* Ability to load in text-based lists of servers, representing
  server sets.
* Ability to load in different remote usernames for different server sets
  from a text file.
  (i.e. apache@web01, tomcat@app01)
* Ability to work with -one- environment of servers at a time,
  specified at startup via --env=my_environment.
  The idea here is not allow users to mix devel, testing, and production worlds.
* Attempts to connect to all servers port 22, -before- running ssh.
  This health-check prevents "session hang" that can occur by running
  ssh alone.
* Single remote server command execution.
* Multiple set-based remote server command execution.
* Pattern-based group and server name matching for the lazy sysadmin
  in all of us.

Change List For v0.4-v0.45 (Shipped):

* Addition of the "login" command.  Basically allows the user to specify
  a server to login to without having to exit the distribulator.
* Addition of --noping for environments where either a ServerPing is
  undesirable or the installed version of Net::Ping is out-of-date.
* Addition of the "all" group.  This will allow one to run any command
  across every group in the started-up environment.
* Addition of the ability to read in a text-file list of common Unix commands.
* Addition of the ability to distinguish those commands as external and
  simply pass them through to the underlying shell via perl's system() call.

Spontaneous Change List For v0.47 (Shipped):

* Modularized codebase.  Still not all that generic, but at least
  broken out by functionality.  There's still way too many
  inter-dependancies, but it's at least more manageable.
* Various fixes, including that of the Net::Ping code,
  no CPAN module addon required.  Removed --noping as the underlying
  assumption behind it is not valid.
* Term::ReadLine::GNU & GNU libreadline are now required for this
  software to perform correctly(or even run it seems).
* Lots of GNU libreadline functionality: history load/save,
  tab-completion of first word command, some CTRL-C / CTRL-D integration.
* Crude attempts to fix problems relating to running distribulator,
  then exiting and having one's term act very flakey.
* Added ability to abort a command while executing on X servers.
  (Hold down CTRL-C, or just hit it a number of times)
* Improved testing process, thus improved stability.

Spontaneous Change List For v0.48 (Shipped):

* Fixed a silly bug where the command-line prompt wasn't being updated with
  the current server group. --Perl
* Added a -t flag to the run command.  This will allow one to specify
  whether a remote tty is required for a given command.  This has caused
  much pain within my work environment lately.  Use with caution, some
  programs/scripts require -t (i.e. vi) and some will utterly break on
  Linux if given -t (i.e. some custom startup scripts).  --Perl
* Fixed the included wrapper script such that it stores the user's
  pwd on startup, then passes it along to the distribulator such that
  the module directory magic going is transparent.  --Perl
* Fixed code to ignore 'CVS' directories.  --Perl
* Utterly annoyed with the current organization of code / objects,
  a lets-do-it-better version written in Python has begun.  --Python

Change List For v0.5 (Coming Soon!):

* Single local server file to single remote server file copy.
(i.e. scp adace@localhost:/tmp/blah adace@remote01:/some/other/path)
* Single local server file to many remote serveres file copy.
(i.e. scp adace@localhost:/tmp/blah adace@remote[01-10]:/some/other/path)
- Single remote server file to single remote server file copy.
(i.e. scp adace@remote01:/tmp/blah adace@remote02:/some/other/path/)
- Single remote server file to many remote serveres file copy.
(i.e. scp adace@remote01:/tmp/blah adace@remote[01-10]:/some/other/path)

Change List For v0.7 (A little farther out):

- Regular expression support in server hostnames.
- Sudo-based remote permissions checking.
- Other random pie-in-the-sky dreamsicle features.

Change List For v1.0 (Will we ever get here?  Who knows!):

- Integration with ncurses such that one could run a command on 4 servers
  in parallel, and see the output from each of them?
- Auditing capabilities via syslog?
- Other random pie-in-the-sky dreamsicle features.
