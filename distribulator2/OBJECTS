Various objects required for the distribulator to function happily.

Object Package Structure
------------------------

core.*		Core classes sepcific to this application.
core.data.*	Data classes specific to this application.
generic.*	Generic classes -not- specific to this application.

Method Classes
--------------

* core.Batch class

This class shall represent the ability to run commands in a batch fashion,
acting as a controller for the Parser and CommandRunner classes.
Any additional functionality(email notification for example) for batch-only
mode will be added here.

* core.CommandParser class

The heart of the system, this class shall implement the actual command parsing
capabilities of the engine.  It will allow for pass-through Unix shell commands,
turn pseudo-commands into real Unix commands, and provide for appropriate loggin
g.

ExternalCommmand getParsedCommand(InternalCommand)

* core.CommandRunner class

This class shall contain the ability to run both internal and external
commands.

* core.CommandLine class

This class shall represent the distribulator command-line interface.

It will take care of any work regarding GNU readline functionality,
and act as a controller of the Parser and CommandRunner classes
to perform actual work.

* core.ConfigLoader class 

This class shall take care of loading configuration options for
the Config class.

* core.CommandParser class

The heart of the system, this class shall implement the actual command parsing
capabilities of the engine.  It will allow for pass-through Unix shell commands,
turn pseudo-commands into real Unix commands, and provide for appropriate logging.

* generic.Pinger class

This class shall implement a simple API to allow us to attempt to connect
to a server via TCP/22 before attempting scp/ssh to that machine.
It should take protocol type and remote port number as arguments to be truly
generic.

* generic.SysLogger class 

This class shall implement a simple API to wrap around Python's built-in syslog
class.  Syslog itself should help us in this endeavor assuming we log events
with the correct "level" (i.e. DEBUG, INFO, CRIT, etc).

Should we support masking?

Data Classes
------------

- core.storage.Command class.
  core.storage.InternalCommand
  core.storage.ExternalCommand
A data storage class which will hold all relevant information regarding a given
command.

- core.storage.Config class.

A data storage class which will hold all relevant information regarding
the global configuration of the program.  It will hold startup settings,
binary locations, collections of ServerGroup and Server objects, etc. 

- core.storage.Server class.

A data storage class which will hold all relevant information regarding a given server.

- core.storage.ServerGroup class.

A collection of Server classes representing a server group.
Should also provide the ability to return Server lists in either a pre-defined
or sorted order.
